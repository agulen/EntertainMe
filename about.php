          <h1>How It Works</h1>
          <p>EntertainMe organizes your media into three categories, 'Now', 'Later', and 'Done.'</p>
          <p>Whether a sweet new band or an awesome new video game, friends and acquaintances are always making great suggestions of things you must see or do right away. Simply add the media to your 'Now' list as a reminder to go check it out soon.</p>
          <p>Life can be hectic. You don't always have time to read this month's bestseller or watch the hottest new film, but you don't want to forget about it. Simply add it to your 'Later' list to enjoy when life gives you a break. Drinks with tiny umbrellas optional.</p>
          <p>You know that feeling. The one where someone is talking about a book they just finished, and it sounds super familiar. Did you read it? Or did you just hear someone else talk about it? Keep track of it all, simply. Once you've finished that enthralling book or epic movie, simply move it to your 'Done' list where it will serve as a reminder so you never forget!</p>
